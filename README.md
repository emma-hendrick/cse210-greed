# Robot Finds Kitten
Simon Carless once described robotfindskitten as "less a game and more a way of 
life ... It's fun to wander around until you find a kitten, at which point you feel 
happy and can start again". I don't think I could have said it better myself!

## Getting Started
Make sure you have dotnet 6.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open 
a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program 
by running the following commands.
```
dotnet build
dotnet run 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on 
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the 
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green 
arrow or "start debugging" button.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- Game                (source code folder)
+-- Program.cs          (program entry point)    
+-- README.md           (general info)
+-- Unit04.csproj       (dotnet project file)
```
